## with Monocle MVC framework

Developers these days are spoiled with choice when it comes to selecting an MV\* framework for structuring and organizing JavaScript web apps. Backbone, Ember, AngularJS, Spine... the list of new and stable solutions goes on and on, but just how do you decide on which to use in a sea of so many options?

## I introduce myself, I'm Monocle and I'll help you to create amazing Apps with CoffeeScript.

### Friend of my friends
I'm built to work with the most famous libraries of the web development. If your project is desktop you can use me with jQuery and if on the contrary it is a mobile project I will perfectly mixed with QuoJS or Zepto.

### I like writing with class
I'm made to work seamlessly with CoffeeScript, a simple and elegant language. With me all your applications will be pure verbosity and poetry. If you also want to use me in old-school mode with the all powerful of JavaScript.

### I use a grateful pattern
I use the MVC pattern therefore I am a fashion victim. All this would not have been possible if my creator @soyjavi had not met the inspiring work of @maccman. You can contribute and help me to be better everyday.

TodoMVC has been called many things including the 'Speed-dating' and 'Rosetta Stone' of MV* frameworks. Whilst we hope that this project is able to offer assistance in deciding what frameworks are worth spending more time looking at, remember that the Todo application offers a limited view of what a framework may be capable of.

It is meant to be used as a gateway to reviewing how a basic application using a framework may be structured and we heavily recommend investing time researching a solution in more depth before opting to use it.
